            <p>You've come to Mexico City for new experiences right? I can't think of a better place to see, hear, and eat new things.
              There is an island of weird hanging dolls to float by, mariachi bands will jump aboard to sing to you, snacks... drinks..., and... well hey maybe my photos
            will be better at selling the idea to you than I am. You must be reading this because you're interested. Go with your gut and make the trip.</p>

              I feel like Mexico City is an under-rated travel destination. It was by far one of favorite travel trips. I was there for five days...
              I saw a Lucha Libre wresting match, pyramids, went on a boat tour, to an artic bar, drank mezcal with a worm
              in it... (ek!) And the food... ugh, the food... from my chips with chile and lime to all the chilaquiles...
              ... you will be missed.
