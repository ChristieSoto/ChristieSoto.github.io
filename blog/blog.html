          <p>Welcome! My name is Christie... and you have come across my blog. I started this
            to practice my web design skills and to share some of the memories in my life.
            Thanks for stopping by! :D</p>

            <p> When I think about the web… when it was invented… I begin to feel like a dinosaur, pilgrim, or pioneer of some sorts. Thank you, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, when you proposed this crazy “web” concept in 1989. Wait… 1989?? Yep. That’s when I start feeling like a dinosaur. I can’t wait to tell my hypothetical grandchildren that I grew up during the era of the internet, that “back in my day that there ‘world-wide web’ was invented.” It feels so common nature to search things on the web and I really can’t imagine my life without it. Is that sad? Meh. Send me a therapy email at a later time… for now let’s get to the point of this post. *My Coding Journey* Oo0o0o0o0
              And to be quite frank with you, I’m pretty sure I am using the words coder/coding a little out of content, since I’m strictly referring to learning super basic web design/development, but for the sake of matching “Cs” (Christie—Coffee, Cats, and Coding), let’s roll with it.</p>

            <h4>My Trip to Mexico City</h4>

            <p>
              I feel like Mexico City is an under-rated travel destination. It was by far one of favorite travel trips. I was there for five days...
              I saw a Lucha Libre wresting match, pyramids, went on a boat tour, to an artic bar, drank mezcal with a worm
              in it... (ek!) And the food... ugh, the food... from my chips with chile and lime to all the chilaquiles...
              ... you will be missed.
